		question: 'What is Emerald City DAO?',
		answer:
			'Emerald City is the first DAO on the Flow blockchain. We provide the best education in the ecosystem for learning Cadence, the smart contract programming language of the Flow blockchain through our Emerald Academy. In addition, we build products like FLOAT and Emerald Bot, which are used in almost every project also building on the Flow blockchain.'
	},
	{
		question: 'Why do I need an Emerald Pass?',
		answer:
			'We provide a lot of our education & product features for free - and always will! But if you are a power user or your project needs more advanced capabilities, we offer Emerald Pass to give you the most advanced versions of everything we do!'
	},
	{
		question: 'What happens if I cancel my Pass or it expires?',
		answer:
			'If you decide to stop being an Emerald Pass subscriber, then you will still have access to all of the free benefits of our education & products, but you will lose access to the premium benefits.'
	},
	{
		question: 'If I have existing time remaining, and purchase more, what happens?',
		answer:
			'No problem! Any additional time purchased will simply be added onto your existing subscription period.'
	},
	{
		question: 'Will there be more premium features added to Emerald Pass?',
		answer:
			'Yes, absolutely! With every launch of a new product or service, there will be associated benefits for Emerald Pass holders. This makes holding the Pass not only beneficial right now, but for when we do special giveaways, beta tests, and introduce new features on other projects.'
